Notejam
=======

**The easy way to learn web frameworks**

Do you know framework X and want to try framework Y? The easy way to
start with a new framework is to compare it with frameworks you already
know. The goal of the project is to help developers easily learn new
frameworks by examples.

Notejam is a unified sample web application (more than just "Hello
World") implemented using different server-side frameworks. Currently
python, php, ruby and javascript frameworks are supported.
